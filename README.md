## Description

Richèl Bilderbeek will present on “The pros and cons of Open Science 
as discussed in the Uppsala local OS community.”

“Open Science is just science done right”. 
This is a slogan one sometimes hears 
at the local Open Science community in Uppsala, called OSU. 
Most OSU visitors do think Open Science leads to 
better-in-some-way science. 
And we know that it is hard to be critical on 
something most of us prefer so much. 
We do, however, try to remain critical and ask questions 
such as: ‘Is it worth it?’. 
In this webinar, Richèl Bilderbeek talks about some of 
the pros and cons of Open Science and the Uppsala community.

## Talk sketch

This is my sketch. It will change. It will be crap until done.

 * Who I am, relevant for this talk
   * Open Science is a pleonasm
   * Did not leave academia due to discovery of Open Science
   * Abort a position in academia, as not allowed to do Open Science
   * Started OSU
 * OSU is the local Uppsala community
 * Q: who lives in a town with a local community?
 * Q: who visits that local community
 * OSU: 8 visitors now, many interruptions and discussions, in public library
 * OSU next talk: discussion on National Swedish Guidelines on Open Science
 * Lemma 1:
    * Proper science takes more time than sloppy science
    * Open Science forces proper science
    * Hence Open Sciences takes as much or more time
 * Lemma 2:
    * A goal of science is to uncover knowledge/facts/laws
    * Knowledge/facts/laws are reproducible
    * Science is as good as it is reproducible
 * Lemma 3:
    * Assume a sloppy scientist that starts doing Open Science,
      who takes twice as long per paper
    * Reproducibility of that paper goes up a factor of twenty [paper]
    * The scientist is 10x a better scientists
