|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Open Science    | Science @watson2015will | Open Science is a pleonasm [*] |
| Regular science | F science               | Not good enough to pass    |

- Registered reports rule! Always!

# Open Science terminology

## My Open Science definition

- The UNESCO definition @unesco
- My summary of it: 'doing science openly everywhere possible'

![Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_UNESCO_2021.svg](Logo_UNESCO_2021.png)

## Open Science definition 1/2 @unesco

> [O]pen science  is  defined  as  an  inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to  make  multilingual  scientific  knowledge  openly  available,  accessible  and  reusable  for  everyone,  to  increase  scientific  collaborations  and  sharing  of  information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. 

## Open Science definition 2/2 @unesco

> It comprises all scientific disciplines  and  aspects  of  scholarly  practices,  including  basic  and  applied  sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science  communication,  open  engagement  of  societal  actors  and  open  dialogue with other knowledge systems.

# The literature

![Source: https://osf.io/ftkq8](reproducibiity_relocates_time.2400x2400.jpeg)

Too bad! This is unsupported by the literature :confused:

## Cons of Open Access

-   less inclusive for the poor @bahlai2019open @ross2022dynamics
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Data

-   takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   training unaffordable for the poor @bezuidenhout2017beyond @ross2022dynamics
-   sharing sensitive data is hard @scheliga2014putting
-   no sanctions (e.g. when embargo has been met) @scheliga2014putting
-   excludes/inconveniences the industry @ross2022dynamics
-   lack of legal clarity @scheliga2014putting
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Methods

-   takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   may diminish qualitative methodologies for the sake of reproducibility @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Science does not improve statistical power @banks2019answers
-   lack of standards for sharing research materials @scheliga2014putting
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting
-   are 'how to do research', not 'what to research' @banks2019answers
-   may be infeasible, e.g. preregistrations @banks2019answers

## Cons of Open Software

-   reluctance to share code @scheliga2014putting
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Evaluation

-   Open Peer Review may give bias and exclusion @ross2022dynamics
-   no stimulus to publish negative results @scheliga2014putting
-   law of unintended consequences may lead to perverse incentives @banks2019answers
-   competition between scientists discourages openness @scheliga2014putting,
    researcher is put in a social dilemma: @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Infrastructure

- not in place yet @banks2019answers @scheliga2014putting
- financial aspects of openness @scheliga2014putting

## But ...

## Pro 1: F science is a problem @munafo2017manifesto

## Pro 3: better papers 1/3 @soderberg2021initial

![](soderberg_et_al_2021_top.png)

> 5.3 versus 6.3 (on a 10 point scale) for 'Quality of methods',
> a 19% increase

<!-- 
It was found that registered reports
scored better on all criteria. On such criteria is 'Method quality',
where 'regular' papers score 0.29 on average, where registered reports scored.
1.05. Rescaling these values from a [-4, 4] to a [0, 8] scale 
(by simply adding 4.0), results in values 4.29 and 5.05 respectively.
From that one can conclude that registered reports have an 18% higher method quality.
If that percentage is worth it, is still an open question.

# The Open Science Uppsala community

## Question 1

Who lives in a town with a local community?

## Question 2

Who has visited that local community at least once?

## My statement

`community + literature > 2 * literature`,
if not working on Open Science as a scientist


## Open Science Uppsala goals

::: {.column width="50%"}
Developing how to make data FAIR.
Sometimes, the machines come to the researches,
but sometimes they need to visit the facility

Resulted in @larsson2023fair.

## Open may be unfair to companies

::: columns

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
A company can be built around a non-sharable resource.
It would be unfair to share that resource.

## Open source alleviates constraints

::: {.column width="35%"}
Openly develop useful software and avoiding bureaucracy

## Qualitative research is different

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231208_anna.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
Replication does not make sense for qualitative papers,
(e.g. 'What is democracy?'), 
so those fields need to be judged differently.

## Citizen science helps

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231020_ismail.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
Achieving statistical power ignores the individual.
Citizen science helps find strong effects in few individuals.

## Preregistration with statistical power 1/2

::: columns

![](20231110_adam.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
One can do a specification curve analysis
in a pre-registered study to keep statistical power

## Preregistration with statistical power 2/2 @simonsohn2020specification

![](simonsohn_et_al_2020_fig_2_modified_higher_better_legend.png)

## Science is more complex 1/4

::: columns

![](gustav_nilsonne.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Gustav Nilsonne
- Even if data is open, different teams can draw opposite conclusions with high confidence  @botvinik2020variability
- This makes interpreting results even harder!
:::

## Science is more complex 2/4 @botvinik2020variability

![](botvik-nezer_et_al_2020_fig_2.png)

Hypotheses: 'There is [an effect] in [a brain area] between
treatment A and B'

## Science is more complex 4/4 @botvinik2020variability

![](botvin-nezer_et_al_2020_some_rows.png)

And we are confident! Compare hypothesis 2 for team 2 and 4!

## Bias for preregistration

> Good science means never needing to say 'trust me'.
> Simine Vazire

- My bias: likelier to believe open science papers, especially preregistrations
- Please ask me to participate in your experiment with hypothesis
  'Mock papers labeled as preregistrations pass peer review more often'!

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 1/4

My worry: 

- Cultural constraints limit (well-willing!) development of Open infrastructure
- Procedure-first, instead of scientists-first
- Please ask me to participate in your experiment with title
  'The relation between administrative load and open data published over
  multiple countries'

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 2/4

What a Swedish life-science scientist needs to do 
(example from  <https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/>):

1. Read Submission Guidelines
1. Submit (many steps)
1. Wait for a human to review

See also @bowman2023open <!--  They avoid the discussion how science admin should be organized -->

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 3/4

What I want:

1. dump the data in 5 minutes
1. get direct automated review that can be ignored
1. be contacted later
1. data steward does most of the work

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 4/4

My recommendation table in Sweden today:

Open Science  |Admin            |Publish FAIR data?
--------------|-----------------|------------------
Love          |-                |Yes
Like          |Dislike          |No
Like          |Less than dislike|Yes
Less than like|-                |No

# Discussion

-   I hope to have convinced you that ...

`community + literature > 2 * literature`,
if not working on Open Science as a scientist

-   ... is true, because people have broader ideas than you search the literature for
-   ENLIGHT is a community too!
-   Please enlighten me with more references to the literature!
