# This talk

-   Experiment 1: Cons: `more_literature`
-   Experiment 2: Pros: `literature`
-   Experiment 3: Community: `community`

# Experiment 1: `more_literature`

-   Research question: what are the biggest drawbacks of Open Science for a researcher today?
-   Methods: search 5 hours, collect all results, rank these

## Results: least relevant

Feature:

-   Open Methods describe 'how to do research', not 'what to research' @banks2019answers

Dispelling myths:

-   Open Science does not improve statistical power @banks2019answers
-   Open Infrastructure costs money too @scheliga2014putting

No idea what to think of this:

-   Open Science *may* be neoliberal @uygun2023open

## Results: maybe relevant

-   Open Access *may be* less inclusive for the poor @bahlai2019open @ross2022dynamics
-   There *may be* impactful cultural and institutional constraints on all facets of Open Science @scheliga2014putting
-   Training to do proper Open Data *may be* unaffordable for the poor @bezuidenhout2017beyond @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Methods *may* diminish qualitative methodologies for the sake of reproducibility @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Software *may be* hindered by reluctance to share code @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Peer Review *may* give bias and exclusion @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Evaluation *may* lead to perverse incentives @banks2019answers
-   Competition between scientists *may* discourage openness @scheliga2014putting, researcher *may* be put in a social dilemma: @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Evaluation does not encourage to publish negative results @scheliga2014putting

## Results: most relevant

-   Open Methods takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Data (a.o. FAIRification) takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting, especially sharing sensitive data is more complex, @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Data excludes/inconveniences the industry @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Data has no clear legal guidelines, nor sanctions @scheliga2014putting
-   Lack of standards for sharing research materials @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Infrastructure is not in place yet @banks2019answers @scheliga2014putting

# Experiment 2

-   Research question: what are my favorite papers on Open Science that I know?
-   Methods: copy-paste these from earlier discussions

## Result: regular science is a problem @munafo2017manifesto

## Result: Open Science results in better papers 1/3 @soderberg2021initial

![](soderberg_et_al_2021_top.png)

```{=html}
<!-- 
5.3 versus 6.3 (on a 10 point scale) for 'Quality of methods', a 19% increase

It was found that registered reports
scored better on all criteria. On such criteria is 'Method quality',
where 'regular' papers score 0.29 on average, where registered reports scored.
1.05. Rescaling these values from a [-4, 4] to a [0, 8] scale 
(by simply adding 4.0), results in values 4.29 and 5.05 respectively.
From that one can conclude that registered reports have an 18% higher method quality.
If that percentage is worth it, is still an open question.

# Experiment 3

-   Research question: what are the pros and cons of Open Science for a researcher today?
-   Methods: visit meetings, select favorites

## The Open Science Uppsala community

-   Who lives in a town with a local community?
-   Who has visited that local community at least once?

## My statement

```
literature + community

           >
           
literature + more_literature
```

## It takes time to setup an infrastructure

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
Developing how to make data FAIR. Sometimes, the machines come to the researches, but sometimes they need to visit the facility.

Resulted in @larsson2023fair. See also @banks2019answers @scheliga2014putting.

## Open may be unfair to companies

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20230908_martin.png)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
A company can be built around a non-sharable resource. It would be unfair to share that resource.

## Open source alleviates constraints

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}

:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
Openly develop useful software and avoiding bureaucracy helps your software getting used.

## Qualitative research is different

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231208_anna.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
Replication does not make sense for qualitative papers, (e.g. 'What is democracy?'), so those fields need to be judged differently.

## Citizen science helps

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231020_ismail.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
Achieving statistical power ignores the individual. Citizen science helps find strong effects in few individuals.

## Preregistration with statistical power 1/2

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231110_adam.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
One can do a specification curve analysis in a pre-registered study to keep statistical power

## Science is more complex 1/4

-   Gustav Nilsonne
-   Even if data is open, different teams can draw opposite conclusions with high confidence @botvinik2020variability
-   This makes interpreting results even harder!

## Science is more complex 2/4 @botvinik2020variability

![](botvik-nezer_et_al_2020_fig_2.png)

Hypotheses: 'There is \[an effect\] in \[a brain area\] between treatment A and B'

## Science is more complex 3/4 @botvinik2020variability

## Science is more complex 4/4 @botvinik2020variability

![](botvin-nezer_et_al_2020_some_rows.png)

And we are confident! Compare hypothesis 2 for team 2 and 4!

# Conclusion

-   I hope to have convinced you that ...

```
literature + community

           >
           
literature + more_literature
```

-   ... is true, because people have broader ideas than you search the literature for
-   This is a community too!
