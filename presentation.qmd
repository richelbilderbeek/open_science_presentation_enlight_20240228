# Experiment 1

-   Research question: what are the biggest drawbacks of Open Science for a researcher today?
-   Methods: search 5 hours, collect all results, rank these

## Results: least relevant

Feature:

-   Open Methods describe 'how to do research', not 'what to research' @banks2019answers

Dispelling myths:

-   Open Science does not improve statistical power @banks2019answers
-   Open Infrastructure costs money too @scheliga2014putting

No idea what to think of this:

-   Open Science *may* be neoliberal @uygun2023open

## Results: maybe relevant

-   Open Access *may be* less inclusive for the poor @bahlai2019open @ross2022dynamics
-   There *may be* impactful cultural and institutional constraints on all facets of Open Science @scheliga2014putting
-   Training to do proper Open Data *may be* unaffordable for the poor @bezuidenhout2017beyond @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Methods *may* diminish qualitative methodologies for the sake of reproducibility @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Software *may be* hindered by reluctance to share code @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Peer Review *may* give bias and exclusion @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Evaluation *may* lead to perverse incentives @banks2019answers
-   Competition between scientists *may* discourage openness @scheliga2014putting, researcher *may* be put in a social dilemma: @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Evaluation does not encourage to publish negative results @scheliga2014putting

## Results: most relevant

-   Open Methods takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Data (a.o. FAIRification) takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting, especially sharing sensitive data is more complex, @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Data excludes/inconveniences the industry @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Data has no clear legal guidelines, nor sanctions @scheliga2014putting
-   Lack of standards for sharing research materials @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Infrastructure is not in place yet @banks2019answers @scheliga2014putting

# Experiment 2

-   Research question: what are my favorite papers on Open Science that I know?
-   Methods: copy-paste these from earlier discussions

## Result: regular science is a problem @munafo2017manifesto

## Result: Open Science results in better papers 1/3 @soderberg2021initial

![](soderberg_et_al_2021_top.png)

```{=html}
<!-- 
5.3 versus 6.3 (on a 10 point scale) for 'Quality of methods', a 19% increase

It was found that registered reports
scored better on all criteria. On such criteria is 'Method quality',
where 'regular' papers score 0.29 on average, where registered reports scored.
1.05. Rescaling these values from a [-4, 4] to a [0, 8] scale 
(by simply adding 4.0), results in values 4.29 and 5.05 respectively.
From that one can conclude that registered reports have an 18% higher method quality.
If that percentage is worth it, is still an open question.

Developing how to make data FAIR. Sometimes, the machines come to the researches, but sometimes they need to visit the facility.

## Open may be unfair to companies

::: columns

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
A company can be built around a non-sharable resource. It would be unfair to share that resource.

## Qualitative research is different

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231208_anna.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
Replication does not make sense for qualitative papers, (e.g. 'What is democracy?'), so those fields need to be judged differently.

## Citizen science helps

Achieving statistical power ignores the individual. Citizen science helps find strong effects in few individuals.

# Conclusion

-   I hope to have convinced you that ...

`literature + community > literature + more_literature`

-   ... is true, because people have broader ideas than you search the literature for
-   This is a community too!

## Appendix

## How to pronounce my name?

| Language  | Pronounciation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Dutch** | 'Rie-sjel'     |
| English   | 'Rea-shell'    |
| French    | 'Richèl'       |
| German    | 'Ri-shäll'     |
| Swedish   | 'Ri-kjell'     |

## What I think

My quote (similar to @watson2015will):

```{verbatim}
Open Science is a pleonasm. 
```

My favorite research question:

```{verbatim}
When is Open Science worth the extra effort?
```

My prediction:

```{verbatim}
If doing Open Science would take less time 
than regular science,
it would quickly become the norm. 
This is possible.
```

# Open Science terminology

## My Open Science definition

-   The UNESCO definition @unesco
-   My summary of it: 'doing science openly everywhere possible'

![Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_UNESCO_2021.svg](Logo_UNESCO_2021.png)

## Open Science definition 1/2 @unesco

> \[O\]pen science is defined as an **inclusive** construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community.

## Open Science definition 2/2 @unesco

> It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems.

## Literature: con


## Experiment for bias for preregistration

> Good science means never needing to say 'trust me'. Simine Vazire

-   My bias: likelier to believe open science papers, especially preregistrations
-   Please ask me to participate in your experiment with hypothesis 'Mock papers labeled as preregistrations pass peer review more often'!

# My synthesis

-   rooted in my experience
-   may be provocative
-   to be discussed

## My synthesis: statement

Although Open Infrastructure development is paved with good intentions, cultural and institutional constraints in Sweden discourages Open Science even more.

Instead, we need to go from procedure-first to researcher-first.

## My synthesis: assumptions

-   We know Open Science costs more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   There may be relevant cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting
-   For those that do Open Science, infrastructure is the biggest problem (ENLIGHT poll)

## My synthesis: evidence

What a Swedish life-science scientist needs to do (example from <https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/>):

1.  Read Submission Guidelines
2.  Submit (many steps)
3.  Wait for a human to review, may take days

I call this 'procedure-first'.

See (especially) @charlton2010cancer and @bowman2023open <!--  They avoid the discussion how science admin should be organized -->

## My synthesis: solution

What I want:

1.  dump the data in 5 minutes
2.  get direct automated review that can be ignored
3.  be contacted later
4.  data steward does most of the work
5.  when improving the data, get direct automated review that can be ignored

I call this 'researcher-first'. This ruthless approach should make Open Science take *less* time than regular science

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 4/4

My recommendation table in Sweden today:

| Open Science   | Admin                       | Publish FAIR data? |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Love           | \-                          | Yes                |
| Like           | Dislike @charlton2010cancer | No                 |
| Like           | Less than dislike           | Yes                |
| Less than like | \-                          | No                 |

## How to support

![](poll_enlight_how_support.png)

# Discussion

-   Why do you think 'Open Science is a pleonasm' is invalid/valid?
-   When do you think Open Science is worth the extra effort?
-   I claim 'If doing Open Science would take less time than regular science, it would quickly become the norm'
    - Why do you agree/disagree?
    - Why do you think this is possible yes/no?
