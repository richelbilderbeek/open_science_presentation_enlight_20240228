## My quote

> Open Science is a pleonasm.  Richèl Bilderbeek 

(similar to @watson2015will)

## My favorite research question

Is Open Science worth the extra effort?

# This talk

- Things I learned from the literature
- Things I learned from the community
- Compare these

# Literature

## Experiment 1

- Research question: what are the biggest drawbacks of Open Science for a researcher today?
- Methods: search 5 hours, collect all results, rank these

### Results: irrelevant

No idea what to think of this:

-   Open Science *may* be neoliberal @uygun2023open

Feature:

-   Open Methods describe 'how to do research', not 'what to research' @banks2019answers

Dispelling myths:

-   Open Science does not improve statistical power @banks2019answers
-   Open Infrastructure costs money too @scheliga2014putting

### Results: things that may be

-   Open Access *may be* less inclusive for the poor @bahlai2019open @ross2022dynamics
-   There *may be* impactful cultural and institutional constraints on
    all facets of Open Science @scheliga2014putting
-   Training to do proper Open Data *may be* unaffordable for the poor @bezuidenhout2017beyond @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Methods  *may* diminish qualitative methodologies for the sake of reproducibility @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Software *may be* hindered by reluctance to share code @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Peer Review *may* give bias and exclusion @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Evaluation *may* lead to perverse incentives @banks2019answers
-   Competition between scientists *may* discourage openness @scheliga2014putting, 
    researcher *may* be put in a social dilemma: @scheliga2014putting

### Results: things that are and are improving

-   Open Data has no clear legal guidelines, nor sanctions (e.g. when embargo has been met) @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Evaluation does not encourage to publish negative results @scheliga2014putting
-   Lack of standards for sharing research materials @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Infrastructure is not in place yet @banks2019answers @scheliga2014putting

### Results: things that are and are hard to solve

-   Open Data (a.o. FAIRification) takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting,
    especially sharing sensitive data is more complex,  @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Methods takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   Open Data excludes/inconveniences the industry @ross2022dynamics

## Experiment 2

- Research question: what are my favorite papers on Open Science that I know?
- Methods: copy-paste these from earlier discussions

### Result: regular science is a problem @munafo2017manifesto

### Result: Open Science results in better papers 1/3 @soderberg2021initial

![](soderberg_et_al_2021_top.png)

```{=html}
<!-- 
5.3 versus 6.3 (on a 10 point scale) for 'Quality of methods', a 19% increase

It was found that registered reports
scored better on all criteria. On such criteria is 'Method quality',
where 'regular' papers score 0.29 on average, where registered reports scored.
1.05. Rescaling these values from a [-4, 4] to a [0, 8] scale 
(by simply adding 4.0), results in values 4.29 and 5.05 respectively.
From that one can conclude that registered reports have an 18% higher method quality.
If that percentage is worth it, is still an open question.

# The Open Science Uppsala community

## Question 1

Who lives in a town with a local community?

## Question 2

Who has visited that local community at least once?

## My statement

`literature + community > literature + more_literature`

Developing how to make data FAIR. Sometimes, the machines come to the researches, but sometimes they need to visit the facility

## Open may be unfair to companies

::: columns

:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
A company can be built around a non-sharable resource. It would be unfair to share that resource.

Openly develop useful software and avoiding bureaucracy helps your software getting used

## Qualitative research is different

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](20231208_anna.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
Replication does not make sense for qualitative papers, (e.g. 'What is democracy?'), so those fields need to be judged differently.

## Citizen science helps

Achieving statistical power ignores the individual. Citizen science helps find strong effects in few individuals.

# Discussion

-   I hope to have convinced you that ...

`literature + community > literature + more_literature`

-   ... is true, because people have broader ideas than you search the literature for
-   ENLIGHT is a community too!
-   Please help me/us with more references to the literature!

## Appendix

# Open Science terminology

## My Open Science definition

-   The UNESCO definition @unesco
-   My summary of it: 'doing science openly everywhere possible'

![Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_UNESCO_2021.svg](Logo_UNESCO_2021.png)

## Open Science definition 1/2 @unesco

> \[O\]pen science is defined as an **inclusive** construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community.

## Open Science definition 2/2 @unesco

> It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems.

## Bias for preregistration

> Good science means never needing to say 'trust me'. Simine Vazire

-   My bias: likelier to believe open science papers, especially preregistrations
-   Please ask me to participate in your experiment with hypothesis 'Mock papers labeled as preregistrations pass peer review more often'!

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 1/4

My worry:

-   Cultural constraints limit (well-willing!) development of Open infrastructure
-   Procedure-first, instead of scientists-first
-   Please ask me to participate in your experiment with title 'The relation between administrative load and open data published over multiple countries'

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 2/4

What a Swedish life-science scientist needs to do (example from <https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/>):

1.  Read Submission Guidelines
2.  Submit (many steps)
3.  Wait for a human to review

See also @bowman2023open <!--  They avoid the discussion how science admin should be organized -->

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 3/4

What I want:

1.  dump the data in 5 minutes
2.  get direct automated review that can be ignored
3.  be contacted later
4.  data steward does most of the work

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 4/4

My recommendation table in Sweden today:

| Open Science   | Admin                       | Publish FAIR data? |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Love           | \-                          | Yes                |
| Like           | Dislike @charlton2010cancer | No                 |
| Like           | Less than dislike           | Yes                |
| Less than like | \-                          | No                 |
