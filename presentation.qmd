# This presentation

<https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/open_science_presentation_enlight_20240228> ![](CC0.png)

All puns are unintended!

# Goal

To share some insights of my local Open Science community.

# Overview

-   Who I am
-   Open Science Uppsala community
-   Open Science insights from a literature search
-   Open Science insights from talks

# What I do

## What I think

| Name            | My suggested name       | My reasoning               |
|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Regular science | F science               | Not good enough to pass    |
| Open Science    | Science @watson2015will | Open Science is a pleonasm |

## Question 1

Who lives in a town with a local community?

## Question 2

Who has visited that local community at least once?

## My statement

`community + literature > 2 * literature`,
if not working on Open Science as a scientist

    - What I already knew
    - What I learned from the literature
    - `"Open Science" + problems` and synonyms
    - Please send me (references to) papers!
- Community:

# The literature

## Pro of Open Science

- Open Science is just (grade A) science @watson2015will
- greater faith in research @allen2019open

## Overview of Open Science facets

![Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Osc2021-unesco-open-science-no-gray.png](Osc2021-unesco-open-science-no-gray.png)

## Cons of Open Access

-   less inclusive for the poor @bahlai2019open @ross2022dynamics
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Data

-   training unaffordable for the poor @bezuidenhout2017beyond @ross2022dynamics
-   sharing sensitive data is hard @scheliga2014putting
-   no sanctions (e.g. when embargo has been met, 'Ineffective policy guidelines' @scheliga2014putting
-   takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   excludes/inconveniences the industry @ross2022dynamics
-   Lack of legal clarity @scheliga2014putting
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Methods

-   may diminish qualitative methodologies for the sake of reproducibility @ross2022dynamics
-   Open Science does not improve statistical power @banks2019answers
-   lack of standards for sharing research materials @scheliga2014putting
-   takes more time @allen2019open @scheliga2014putting
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting
-   are 'how', not 'what to' study @banks2019answers
-   may be infeasible, e.g. preregistrations @banks2019answers

## Cons of Open Source Software

-   Reluctance to share code @scheliga2014putting
-   cultural and institutional constraints @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Evaluation

-   Open Peer Review: may give bias and exclusion @ross2022dynamics
-   No stimulus to publish negative results @scheliga2014putting
-   Competition discourages openness ('Evaluation criteria impede openness', @scheliga2014putting)
-   law of unintended consequences may lead to perverse incentives @banks2019answers
-   researcher is put in a social dilemma: @scheliga2014putting

## Cons of Open Infrastructure

- not in place yet @banks2019answers @scheliga2014putting
- financial aspects of openness @scheliga2014putting

# The community

## It takes time to setup an infrastructure

Developing how to make data FAIR.
Sometimes, the machines come to the researches,
but sometimes they need to visit the facility

## Open may be unfair to companies

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
A company can be built around a non-sharable resource.
It would be unfair to share that resource.

## Open source alleviates constraints

::: {.column width="50%"}
Openly develop useful software and avoiding bureaucracy
helps your software getting used

## Open science in qualitative research is different

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](20231208_anna.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Replication does not make sense for qualitative papers,
(e.g. 'What is democracy?'), 
so those fields need to be judged differently.

## Citizen science can help find individual effects

## Preregistration with statistical power 1/2

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
One can do a specification curve analysis
in a pre-registered study to keep statistical power

Even if data is open, 
different teams can draw opposite conclusions

## Science is more complex 2/4 @botvinik2020variability

Hypotheses: 'There is [an effect] in [a brain area] between
treatment A and B'

## Bias for preregistration

- My bias: likelier to believe preregistrations
- 'If not open, I do not believe you'

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 1/4

My worry: 

- cultural constraints limit (well-willing!) development of Open infrastructure
- procedure-first, instead of scientists-first

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 2/4

What a scientist needs to do (example from  <https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/>):

1. Read Submission Guidelines
1. Submit (many steps)
1. Wait for a human to review

See also @bowman2023open

<!--  They avoid the discussion how science admin should be organized -->

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 3/4

What a scientists wants:

1. dump the data in 5 minutes
1. get direct automated review that can be ignored
1. be contacted later
1. data steward does most of the work

## Cultural limits Open infrastructure 4/4

My recommendation table:

How to publish data       |Dislike admin |Hate admin
--------------------------|--------------|------------
Neutral about Open Science|Don't         |Don't
Like Open Science         |Infrastructure|Don't
Love Open Science         |Infrastructure|Infrastructure

## Next OSU talk

![](20240315_osu.jpg)

# Swedish national Open Science guidelines

1.  Open access to scientific publications
2.  Open access to research data
3.  Open research methods
4.  Open learning resources
5.  Public participation in the research process
6.  Infrastructures that support open science

# Pros and cons

-   More reproducible science
-   More transparent science

# Discussion

-   I hope to have convinced you that ...

`community + literature > 2 * literature`,
if not working on Open Science as a scientist

-   ... is true, because people have broader ideas than you search the literature for
-   ENLIGHT is a community too!
-   Please enlighten me with more references to the literature!
